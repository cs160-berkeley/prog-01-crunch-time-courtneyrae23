# PROG 01: Crunch Time

CrunchTime has two main modes: Exercise Mode and Calorie Mode. The default is Exercise Mode where the user first selects an exercise. Next, the user enters in how many minutes/reps for the exercise (the minutes/reps label updates based on what exercise has been selected). Finally, the user hits the convert button and the number of calories burned is generated, along with the number of minutes or reps needed for each exercise to burn the same number of calories displayed in each icon. To switch to Calorie Mode, the user must click the button in the bottom right-hand corner. When in Calorie Mode, the user simply enters in the number of calories they wish to burn and hits the covert button. The number of minutes or reps needed for each exercise to burn that number of calories appears in each icon. Finally, the user can choose to enter a different weight than the default 150 pounds by simply typing in a different value. All of the calories burned and minutes/reps equivalency calculations will be generated using this weight.
